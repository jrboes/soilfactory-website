Movie nights (usually Friday) allow discussion of unusual films that challenge us to think outside the box,- whether made during silent film era at the beginning the 20th century or just last year. Shown inside or projected onto the wavy metal walls of The Soil Factory, even in rain or snow, the conversations before and after the film create a community of those interested in new ideas.
