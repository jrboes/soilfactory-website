Residencies are open to anyone who is interested in engaging with the community at The Soil Factory, including but not limited to artists, scientists, musicians, community organizers, activists, environmentalists. This program started in November 2021 and utilizes a small house with access to the land and programming at The Soil Factory. We are experimenting with innovative approaches to bring people together that would normally not meet to generate connections for building a sustainable future. A few examples where exciting networks started to expand in unexpected ways, are listed below…
